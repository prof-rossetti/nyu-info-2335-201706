# JavaScript Language Overview

## Syntax and Style

### Semi-colons

You may see JavaScript statements ended with a trailing semi-colon. In some cases it is necessary to use these trailing semi-colons, but you are generally free to omit them.

### Naming

Always observe lower-case variable and function names. If your variable or function name is comprised of two words, use camel-case, not snake case. As usual, only use title case for class names.

DO:

  + `name`
  + `firstName`
  + `lastName`
  + `firstAndLastName`
  + `Human` - use title case for classes only
  + `SuperHuman` - use title case for classes only

DON'T:

+ `first_name`
+ `last_name`
+ `first_and_last_name`
