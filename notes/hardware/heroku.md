# Heroku Overview

To host dynamic applications which rely on server-side software, many developers use a hosting provider called [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

> Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps â€” we're the fastest way to go from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches. - [Heroku website](https://www.heroku.com/what)

Heroku provides developers with the ability to configure and manage remote servers. Developers configure one or more of these servers to host a web application's source code and serve HTTP responses upon request. Each Heroku server has a unique URL address to allow in some cases public visitation over the Internet, and in all cases the ability to remote login to your server to run commands, check server logs, etc.

The Heroku platorm is able to serve applications written in many of today's popular programming languages, including Node.js, Python, Ruby, and more. This means learning how to manage Heroku servers will be beneficial regardless of which programming language you are using at the moment. Heroku can host all kinds of apps.

For more information about how Heroku works, see: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/how-heroku-works.

Heroku for Python Reference:

## Prerequisites

  + Login to an existing Heroku account, or [register](https://signup.heroku.com/) for a new one. Make sure to confirm your account by clicking a confirmation link the confirmation email sent to you by Heroku.

> Security Alert: consider eventually enabling multi-factor authentication on your Heroku account to keep your account and your servers safe from intrusion. Don't worry about doing this now if you don't feel like it, but take a moment to do so when you have time.

> NOTE: In order to provision some services like databases and email, you may need to provide Heroku with billing information. You can expect to not be charged as long as you are using the free version of each of these services. Just be aware.

## Installation

In addition to using Heroku's online platform, we will use the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) command-line utility to interface with Heroku's resources and capabilities.

Source Code: https://github.com/heroku/cli.

Installation Guide: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install.

``` shell
# Mac Terminal
which heroku #> /usr/local/bin/heroku

# Windows Command Prompt
where heroku #> ...
```

> NOTE for Windows OS users who download the Heroku Toolbelt CLI (h/t @rjzap):
>
> The default installation settings will have a version of git checked as part of the install. You can uncheck the git portion of the download package to avoid any potential conflicts with the git already installed on your computer, it will not prevent the heroku package from running successfully.
>
> Once installed you have to change your directory to the download location to run the heroku commands. The filepath will be: `<your chosen download folder>\heroku\bin`.


## Authentication

After installing Heroku Toolbelt, authenticate using your Heroku account credentials:

```` sh
heroku login
````

Authentication Guide: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#getting-started.

## Usage

List applications:

```` sh
heroku apps
````

Create a Heroku application server (ideally from within the root directory of an existing project):

```` sh
heroku create # or optionally specify a name, like: heroku create my-app-name
````

Deploy the application's source code to the application server:

```` sh
git push origin master # best practice: commit and push your code to a remote repository before deploying
git push heroku master
````

Visit the application in a browser and note its URL for future reference:

```` sh
heroku open
````

Check your application's server logs:

```` sh
heroku logs
````
