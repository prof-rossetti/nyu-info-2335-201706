# Python Language Overview

## Comments

Use comments to convey some message without having it be executed by an interpreter. Comment by using the `#` sign followed by the commented message:

```python
# This is a single-line comment. It won't be executed.
```

Unlike other languages, Python doesn't offer multi-line comments, so the best you can do is put a comment on every line:

```python
#
# This is a multi-line comment.
# It won't be executed.
#
```
