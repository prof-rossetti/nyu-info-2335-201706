# Welcome

Hello students,

I'm looking forward to meeting you all next Wednesday night for our first Python Programming class.

In the meantime, please fill out this [pre-semester survey](https://goo.gl/forms/OUsW5QVeIvbeczwK2) to help me get a better understanding of your experiences and expectations.

Thanks, and see you next week!

\- Professor Rossetti
