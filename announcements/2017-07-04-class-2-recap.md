# Class 2 Recap

Hello Students.

Happy July 4th! I hope you have a relaxing and enjoyable (and perhaps maybe even productive) holiday.

Thanks for a great class last night. It is clear to see you are quick learners, and I am heartened to see us finding effective ways to collaborate and help each other during class. You are collectively exceeding my expectations, so thank you for your efforts!

Last night we worked together to demonstrate the process of [submitting your Human Software projects](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/projects/human-software/project.md#submission-instructions). Then we worked independently on a [Command-line Computing exercise](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/exercises/command-line-computing/exercise.md) and a [Version Control exercise](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/exercises/version-control/exercise.md) - these exercises form a foundation for the rest of the semester. After that we worked independently to [install Python](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/notes/programming-languages/python/installation.md) and start [exploring its capabilities](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/notes/programming-languages/python/notes.md).

If you missed class, please prepare for next class by making sure you have at the very least completed the Command-line Computing and Version Control exercises.

Tomorrow night we will start class by working together to demonstrate and highlight important command-line computing techniques. Then we will continue to work together to demonstrate and highlight important capabilities of the Python language. Then we will take some time to work independently on the Python exercise. Then if there is time we will work through the Python exercise together step-by-step.

Please be aware I will most likely be converting the Python exercise into a graded project to be due instead of the Shopping Cart project on Sunday night, and pushing back the Shopping Cart project and reconfiguring the rest of the learning activities accordingly. I will announce more details at the beginning of next class.

See you then!
