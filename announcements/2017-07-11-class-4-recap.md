# Class 4 Recap

Hello Students,

Thanks for a fun and engaging class last night.

We started class by discussing version control and performing the process of updating our local and remote "forks" of the course repository.

We then resumed working together through the ["Groceries" project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/projects/groceries/project.md), which we didn't finish, so I pushed back the due date to Wednesday night at 11:59pm. If you haven't yet submitted it, I encourage you to do so on your own, otherwise we will finish and submit it together at the beginning of next class.

At the end of class I introduced the ["Shopping Cart" project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/projects/shopping-cart/project.md), which we will work on independently during a significant portion of next class. I pushed back the due date of this project to Sunday night at 11:59pm.

See you tomorrow night.

\- Professor Rossetti
