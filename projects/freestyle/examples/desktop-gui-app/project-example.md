Use Python to create a desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI).

![a screencast of using the program. a desktop window comes up. the user inputs some values and selects some things. then upon button click the terminal outputs the values of all selected items](demo.gif)

For optional further exploration, integrate any one of the other project examples with a graphical user interface.
