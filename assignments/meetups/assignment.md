# Meetups

## Learning Objectives

  1. Explore your local technology community.
  2. Network with technology industry professionals.
  3. Increase awareness of industry practices.

## Instructions

Search [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) for, or otherwise identify business, startup, and/or technology-related events in the New York City area or some other place near where you live. Focus on Python and/or software-related events if possible. You are encouraged to post links to interesting events in the `#meetups` Slack channel.

Attend two events over the course of the semester.

Write a short (2-3 page) summary of your experiences,
 to address at least the following questions:

 + Which events did you attend, which groups hosted them, and what happened at each?
 + What, if anything, did you learn about contemporary industry challenges and practices?
 + For each group: Have you returned to attend subsequent events hosted by this group? Would you recommend the group to a friend? Why or why not?

Embed photos to provide further evidence of event attendance. A "selfie" should suffice if it features distinguishable event imagery in the background.

## Alternate Assignment - Informational Interviews

If the idea of attending business and technology community events makes you uncomfortable, or if your schedule prohibits you from attending two events before the end of the semester,
 you have another option. You may substitute each meetup event with an informational interview of some active member within the business and technology community.

After each interview, write a short (1-2 page) summary of your experiences,
to address at least the following questions:

+ Which professionals did you interview? Include their contact info and a description of their professional roles/duties.
+ How are their professions relevant to the business/technology community?
+ What happened during each interview? What relevant topics were discussed?
+ How did your discussions relate to your own skills and interests?
+ What did you learn about contemporary industry challenges and practices?

If possible, embed photos to provide further evidence of interview participation.
