An **Information System** processes information inputs into information outputs for a specific purpose. Thus its primary conceptual components are **Information Inputs**, **Information Outputs**, and an objective or purpose.

Information systems can perform numeric computations, facilitate communication and collaboration, automate business processes, and more. Information systems provide value to organizations by providing a competitive advantage in terms of cost, quality, speed, accuracy, and/or scale.

Sometimes an information system outputs the same or similar information it receives. But more often a system's objective is to transform information inputs into more valuable information outputs. Information has different value, depending on where it falls within the following **Information Hierarchy**:

term | description | example
--- | --- | ---
**Data** | A description of something, not necessarily organized or synthesized to provide meaning. | Numbers, words, dates, images, files.
**Information** | Data that has been organized or interpreted to provide meaning and value. | A chart of datapoints over time depicting an upward trend in sales.
**Knowledge** | Data and/or Information that has been organized, processed and interpreted to convey understanding, experience, accumulated learning, expertise, etc. | An informed decision to raise marketing expenditure levels.

Information Systems are classified
 based on
  system purpose,
  functionality,
  scope,
  audience,
  and type of information processed:

system type | general functions |  specific example(s)
--- | --- | ---
**Operational** (e.g. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS))| Sends and receives data. | An ATM.
**Managerial** (e.g. Business Intelligence (BI), Management Information Systems (MIS), and some Decision Support Systems (DSS)) | Processes and synthesizes data into information. | A system that produces data dashboards.
**Executive** (e.g. some Decision Support Systems (DSS), Expert Systems, and Machine Learning) | Processes and synthesizes information into knowledge; emulates human decision-making and judgement processes. | A university's Student Housing Selection System, IBM Watson, Tesla Model S

Information systems may or may not leverage technology. Examples of non-tech information systems include: a doctor's paper-based patient records system, a deli's paper-based ordering system, and a [tin-can telephone](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/tin-can-telephones-968914.jpg) system.
 A computer-based information system uses
 a related group of computer components working together
 to process information inputs into information outputs
 for a specific purpose. Technology components of a computer-based information system generally include:

component | description
--- | ---
People | Individuals who use the system.
Processes | Procedures the system performs or facilitates.
**Hardware** | Physical devices such as computers, servers, sensors, monitors, printers, speakers, etc. which perform as instructed by the system's software.
**Software** | Written instructions which govern the system's logic.
**Network** | Facilitates connection and communication between system components, often a computer network such as the Internet.
Datastore | A storage place for the system's information, like a **Database** or file cabinet.
