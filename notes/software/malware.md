# Malware Overview

The term **Malware** refers to software that is created with malicious intent.

> Malware is an abbreviated term meaning “malicious software.”  This is software that is specifically designed to gain access or damage a computer without the knowledge of the owner. There are various types of malware including spyware, keyloggers, true viruses, worms, or any type of malicious code that infiltrates a computer.
>
> Generally, software is considered malware based on the intent of the creator rather than its actual features. Malware creation is on the rise due to the sheer volume of new types created daily and the lure of money that can be made through organized Internet crime. Malware was originally created as experiments and pranks, but eventually led to vandalism and destruction of targeted machines. Today, much of malware is created for profit through forced advertising (adware), stealing sensitive information (spyware), spreading email spam or child pornography (zombie computers), or to extort money (ransomware). - [Norton website](https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-malware.html)

> Malware is any software or mobile application specifically designed to harm a computer, a mobile device, the software it's running, or its users. Malware exhibits malicious behavior that can include installing software without user consent and installing harmful software such as viruses.  - [Google website](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/3258249?hl=en)

Specific categories of malware include:

  + **Virus** - "designed to spread from host to host and has the ability to replicate itself" ([source](https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-malware-what-is-a-computer-virus.html))
  + **Adware** - while not strictly "malicious", adware is used to serve advertisements to users
  + **Spyware** - detects computing activity without the user's knowledge
  + **Phishing** - "uses fraudulent emails or texts, or copycat websites to get you to share valuable personal information – such as account numbers, Social Security numbers, or your login IDs and passwords", which are then used to "steal your money or your identity or both" - ([source](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0003-phishing))
  + **Ransomware** - cripples computer systems and demands a ransom in return for restoring the systems to normal operations

Recent malware attacks in the news:

> The hackers’ weapon of choice on Friday was Wanna Decryptor, a new variant of the WannaCry ransomware, which encrypts victims’ data, locks them out of their systems and demands ransoms. - [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/world/europe/uk-national-health-service-cyberattack.html) on June 27, 2017

&nbsp;

> A vulnerability first uncovered by the National Security Agency and then released by hackers on the internet is now being used in one of the most prolific cyberattacks ever around the globe. It's called WannaCry, and it's brought computer systems from Russia to China to the UK and the US to their knees, locking people out of their data and demanding they pay a ransom or lose everything. So far, more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries have been affected, with victims including hospitals, banks, telecommunications companies and warehouses. - [CNet](https://www.cnet.com/news/wannacry-wannacrypt-uiwix-ransomware-everything-you-need-to-know/) on on May 19th, 2017.


## Hacking

Discussion topic: **Black-hat** vs **White-hat** Hacking.

> White hats are security researchers or hackers who, when they discover a vulnerability in software, notify the vendor so that the hole can be patched.
>
> Black hats are criminals. They use their prowess to find or develop software holes and attack methods (aka zero day vulnerabilities and exploits) or other malicious tools to break into machines and steal data, such as passwords, email, intellectual property, credit card numbers or bank account credentials. They also sell information about the security holes to other criminals for them to use. - [Wired](https://www.wired.com/2016/04/hacker-lexicon-white-hat-gray-hat-black-hat-hackers/)
