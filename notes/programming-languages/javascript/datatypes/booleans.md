# JavaScript Language Overview

## Booleans

Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean.

In JavaScript, like other languages, `true` and `false` are reserved words which indicate boolean values.

```` js
true
false
````

The most relevant boolean operator is the equality operator ("Is this equal to that?"):

```` js
true == true //=> true
true == false //=> false
false == false //=> true
````

Also relevant is the inequality operator ("Is this not equal to that?"):

```` js
true != true //=> false
true != false //=> true
false != false //=> false
````

Reference https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Comparison_operators for more information about comparison operators.
