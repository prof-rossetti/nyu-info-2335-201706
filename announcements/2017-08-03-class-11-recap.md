# Class 11 Recap

Hello Students,

During the first part of last night's class we conducted a ["Retrospective" Exercise](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/exercises/retrospective/exercise.md) where I asked you to provide feedback about our semester together. Thank you for sharing your assessment of things that have been going well and areas that could be improved in the future. I highly value and appreciate your feedback!

We finished class with a Final Exam Preparation Session during which I shared with you information about what to expect on the [Final Exam](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/exams/final/exam.md).

Good luck studying, have a great weekend, and see you on Monday night for our final class of the semester.

\- Professor Rossetti
