# Class 10 Recap

Hello Students,

Last night we spent the entire period working on our ["Freestyle" Project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/projects/freestyle/project.md) implementations. I had a lot of fun pairing with many of you on your projects, and I can see many of you are having fun as well. You have made great progress, and I'm confident in your ability to finish the project before the due date on Sunday night at 11:59pm. In the meantime please play close attention to the [project requirements](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/projects/freestyle/project.md#requirements), including requirements for your repository to contain certain files like a license and an explicit restatement of your project objectives. Slack DM me if you're not sure how a given requirement applies to your project.

Tomorrow night we will conduct a "Retrospective" Exercise, and a Final Exam Preparation Session. I hope to see each of you then!

\- Professor Rossetti
