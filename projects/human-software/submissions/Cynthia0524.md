  2. Put toothpaste on the brush, with length of 1cm (or depend on your own habit).
  3. Gargle with some water.
  4. Turn on the toothbrush.
  5. Choose one quadrant for your mouth (upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right).
  6. Gently hold the brush and clean the outside surface of each tooth, for 15 seconds, following the shape of teeth and curve of gum line to prevent irritating your gum.
  7. Gently brush the inside surface of each tooth, for another 15 seconds, still following the shape of teeth and curve of gum line.
  8. Clean rest 3 quadrants, repeating step 6 and 7.
  9. Gargle with some water and make sure no toothpaste left in your mouth.
  10. Clean your toothbrush. Necessarily, dissemble the brush part to clean more completely.
  11. Put your toothbrush in a clean container, and regularly replace the brush part.
  12. Put away the toothpaste and cup.
  13. Smile in the mirror! :)

##Scan Economics or Financial papers

Target Population: Students first read economics or financial papers for literature review, at the beginning of a research.

Attention: This instruction may not be suitable for everyone. It is just from the author's habit.

Steps:
  1. Assure the problem you are asking, and say it to yourself for as many times as you need.
  2. Anticipate some potential answers of your problem.
  3. Scan the abstract of a selected article, and summarize or pick the key words.
  4. Match the abstract with what you are asking.

    If matched, go to step 5.
    If unmatched, drop the article.
    
  5. Scan the content of the article, and select the parts related to your problem assured in step 1.
  6. Go directly to the conclusion part, and find the discussions related to your problem.

     (Why go to the conclusion first? Compared to the abstract, conclusion part provides moderately more details, but not overwhelming, which is helpful for efficient understanding)
    
  7. Scan the figures and formula of each related part, quickly.
  8. Read and summarize the result of each part, knowing more about the process or method leading to the conclusion.
  
    If you could roughly understand the process or method, go to step 11.    
    If you feel confused, go to step 9.
    
  9. Narrow down the confusing part, and find your problem. Again, say it to yourself for many times.
  
    If you feel this problem is related to your original problem and really needs to be solved, go to step 10. 
    If it is not necessary for this research, write it down and solve it in the future when you have time.
    
  10. Go to the confusing part. Read conclusion for each discussion or comment paragraph for understanding.
  
    If you understand now. Congratulations and go to step 11. 
    If you could not understand what the paper is saying, go to ask Google.
    
  11. Summarize the conclusion and arguments of the paper in one paragraph. Now you get one raw material for your literature review. 
  12. Compare it with your anticipations.
  
    If consistent, see it as your evidence. 
    If inconsistent, find the reason and record it.
