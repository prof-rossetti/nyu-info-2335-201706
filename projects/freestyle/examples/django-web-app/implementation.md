# Freestyle Project Example - CRUD Application w/ Web Interface and SQL Database (Django and PostgreSQL Implementation)

## Implementation

Adapted from the [Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/) and the [Deploying a Django App to Heroku Article](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-python), which are both definitely worth following as well.

### Application Generation

Generate a new application, for example one called `products` or `products_app`, for example, to manage an inventory of grocery products:

```shell
python3 manage.py startapp products_app
```

### Application Development
