# Class 3 Recap

Hello Students.

Last night in class I guided a long and somewhat slow [introduction to the capabilities of the Python programming language](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/notes/programming-languages/python/notes.md) for novice programmers. At the end of class we started applying those concepts to the ["Groceries" project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/projects/groceries/project.md) (formerly known as the "Python" exercise).

If you have not yet already thoroughly reviewed the Python language overview on your own in its entirety (line-by-line), please do so to prepare for next class. There are many intermediate concepts we did not cover in class. Also, I encourage you to try to finish and submit the "Groceries" project, if you are comfortable doing so. FYI - the submission process involves adding a row to an existing CSV file in the course repository, not adding a new file there like last time.

At the beginning of next class we will work together to finish and submit the "Groceries" project. Then I will introduce the "Shopping Cart" project and provide you time to work on it.

Have a great weekend, and see you on Monday!

\- Professor Rossetti
