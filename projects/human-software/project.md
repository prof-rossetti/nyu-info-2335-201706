# Human Software

Provide instructions for how a human could perform various processes of interest.

## Learning Objectives

  1. Practice writing software in English.
  1. Practice contributing to open source software.
  1. Practice version control.

## Instructions

Pick two processes or activities you engage in on a daily basis. One should be the process of brushing your teeth. The other is your choice.

For each process, write instructions in English to communicate to another human, perhaps even a child, how to perform that process.

## Submission Instructions

Add a new file called `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.md` to the [submissions directory](/projects/human-software/submissions), where `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` is your GitHub username. The file should contain your written instructions, separated by process. For example, you might want to use the following template:

    # Human Software

    Author: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME

    ## Brushing Teeth

    Some written instructions here. Maybe numbered:

      1. Do something.
      2. Do something else.
      3. Do a third thing.

    ## My Other Process

    Some written instructions here. Maybe numbered:

      1. Do something.
      2. Do something else.
      3. Do a third thing.

You will need to submit a Pull Request for your content to be included in this course repository. See the [Contributor Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions. At this time, you should expect to be able to submit a PR using the GitHub online interface, so ignore references to the Git CLI.

## Evaluation

Full credit for presence of a file named after your GitHub username which contains instructions for both processes.

Else half credit for file naming errors or a file which contains instructions for performing only one process.

Else no credit.
