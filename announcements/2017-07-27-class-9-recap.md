# Class 9 Recap

Hello Students,

Last night we spent a majority of time researching and investigating potential ["Freestyle" Project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/projects/freestyle/project.md) ideas. Please submit a project [Proposal Form](https://goo.gl/forms/VuwbJiR7Q1JTSYG03) by the end of the night on Sunday.

In class we also talked about some considerations for working with [APIs](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/notes/software/apis.md), how to keep passwords and API Keys secret by using [Environment Variables](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/notes/environment-variables/notes.md), and how to deploy any Python program to a remote server hosted by [Heroku](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/notes/hardware/heroku.md). I ended class with a walk-through of deploying an [example email app](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/projects/freestyle/examples/email-api-client/project-example.md) to Heroku and scheduling the server to send me an email at 10 minute intervals (for demonstration purposes).

On Monday we will continue to work in class implementing our chosen "Freestyle" Projects. If there is interest, I'm tempted to highlight one or more additional Python packages, otherwise we will spend the entire class working independently.

Have a great weekend, and see you next week.

\- Professor Rossetti

FYI - Last night after class I expanded upon the [`Tkinter` package overview](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/notes/programming-languages/python/packages/tkinter.md), which now provides a robust example of how you might expect to create a graphical user interface for your programs. So check it out if you're looking for more ways to have fun with Python.

PS - If you care about badges, I will look favorably upon are encouraged to share links to additional APIs and post your own package overviews
