# Freestyle Project Example - CRUD Application w/ SQL Database

Use Python to create a CRUD application with an SQL database datastore.

> NOTE: It is acceptable and encouraged to build upon your existing [CSV file CRUD Application Project](/projects/crud-application/project.md), switching-out the CSV datastore with an SQL database.

For optional further exploration, deploy your database application to a Heroku server,

For optional further exploration, integrate any one of the other project examples with an SQL database.

For optional further exploration, create a simple web-based interface for your database application, perhaps using the Flask framework.

## Prerequisites

  1. Foundational understanding of Databases and SQL :warning:
  1. [Environment Variables Overview](/notes/environment-variables/notes.md) and [the `os` module](/notes/programming-languages/python/modules/os.md#accessing-environment-variables).
  1. [The `psycopg2` Python Package](/notes/programming-languages/python/packages/psycopg.md) OR [The `PyMySQL` Python Package](/notes/programming-languages/python/packages/pymysql.md)

## Proposal Phase

Example Objective(s):

  + Manage an inventory of products stored in a SQL database.

Example Information Inputs (depending on the chosen objectives):

  + An existing products inventory.
  + Data obtained via API or web service, or by parsing a PDF or scraping the web.
  + Some user input, like a chosen resource and/or CRUD operation.
  + An SQL query.

Example Information Outputs (depending on the chosen objectives):

  + A desired terminal-output of choice.
  + The result of some SQL query.
  + Some changes made to the products inventory.
  + Perhaps some information presented via a web interface

## Implementation Phase

Follow a usage example from one of the database package overviews (`psycopg2`, `PyMySQL`).
