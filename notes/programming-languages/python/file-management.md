# Python Language Overview

## File Management

Use Python to read and write file contents, as well as to create and delete files.

See also: [the `csv` module](../python/modules/csv.md) for reading and writing CSV files, and [the `os` module](../python/modules/os.md) for command-line-style file operations and functionality to help specify file paths.

To setup these examples, create a new directory on your Desktop called `file-mgmt` and navigate there from your command line. Create a Python script in that directory called `my_script.py` and place inside it contents from each of the following sections, respectively.

### Writing Files

Write content to file:

```python
file_name = "my_message.txt" # refers to a file path relative to the path from which you invoke your your script.

with open(file_name, "w") as file: # NOTE: "w" means "open the file for writing"
    file.write("Hello World")
    file.write("\n")
    file.write("\n")
    file.write("...")
    file.write("\n")
    file.write("\n")
    file.write("Goodbye")

#> Hello World
#>
#> ...
#>
#> Goodbye
```

### Reading Files

```python
file_name = "my_message.txt" # refers to a file path relative to the path from which you invoke your your script.

with open(file_name, "r") as file: # NOTE: "r" means "open the file for reading"
    contents = file.read()
    print(contents)

#> Hello World.
#>
#> ...
#>
#> Goodbye World.
```

```python
file_name = "my_message.txt" # refers to a file path relative to the path from which you invoke your your script.

with open(file_name, "r") as file: # NOTE: "r" means "open the file for reading"
    contents = file.read()
    lines = contents.split("\n")
    print("THERE ARE", len(lines), "LINES IN THIS FILE")
    for line in lines:
        print("LINE:", line)

#> THERE ARE 5 LINES IN THIS FILE
#> LINE: Hello World
#> LINE:
#> LINE: ...
#> LINE:
#> LINE: Goodbye.
```
