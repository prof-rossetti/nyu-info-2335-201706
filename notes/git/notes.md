## Git vs GitHub

Git is a command-line utility. Whereas GitHub is an online platform - a social network of sorts - where programmers create profiles and publish software projects.

> GitHub is a development platform inspired by the way you work. From open source to business, you can host and review code, manage projects, and build software alongside millions of other developers. - [GitHub website](https://github.com/)

GitHub and competitor [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) both use Git paradigms and technologies.

GitHub is **the** place to find and explore the world's leading open source code projects. It also provides robust project management features to help you collaborate with other developers.

## Tools (Clients)

You can use a number of different tools and techniques to use Git. The most efficient way is via the command line. But that requires some understanding of command-line computing. So often it's easier to start with a more user-friendly and easy-to-learn tool like one of these [Git GUI](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) applications. Perhaps the leading Git GUI application is [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), however the application can at times run into performance issues (i.e. general slowness), and does not contain all the features of the Git command line utility.

Choose the Git client that works best for you for now, while recognizing you should eventually end up using the [command line](/cli.md).
