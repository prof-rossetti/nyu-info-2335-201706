## Brushing Teeth

  1. Enter your bathroom by twisting the doorknob and opening the door. Close the door behind you.
  2. Walk in and stand in front of the sink.
  3. Open the medicine cabinet and retrieve your toothbrush and tube of toothpaste. Close your medicine cabinet. Hold the toothbrush by the handle, the opposite end of the bristles.
  4. Open the cap of the toothpaste tube and squeeze out one-half inch onto the bristles. 
  5. Open your mouth and bring the toothbrush to your bottom teeth. Brush in a circular motion for one minute across all of your teeth in the front, on top, and the back.
  6. Repeat step #5 for your top teeth.
  7. Brush the roof of your mouth, your tongue, and gums for a combined 30 seconds.
  8. Take the toothbrush out of your mouth and turn on the cold water faucet to rinse the toothpaste from the bristles. Rinse and gargle water in your mouth as well until there is no toothpaste remaining.
  9. Open the medicine cabinet, place your toothbrush and toothpaste tube where they were originally and close the medicine cabinet.

  ## Making an Omlette

  1. Open the refrigerator door by holding the handle and pulling out. Take out the carton of eggs and place them on the counter. Close refrigerator door.
  2. Retrieve two forks from your silverware drawer by opening the drawer. Retrieve a bowl, plate, and cooking spray from the cabinet by opening the cabinet door. Retrieve a skillet from the shelf above your sink.
  3. Open the egg container and select two eggs. Hit the shell lightly on the counter edge so there is a slight crack. Gently pry open the egg shells and release the inside contents in the bowl.
  4. Hold the fork handle and whisk the eggs with the prongs until mixture is frothy.
  5. Place the skillet on the front-left burner and remove the cap from the cooking spray. Spray the skillet evenly for five seconds.
  6. Turn the dial on your stove for the front-left burner to "4." Wait for one minute and pour beaten egg into the skillet.
  7. Wait for four minutes and flip the egg by holding the skillet handle and rocking back and forth.
  8. After two minutes, slide the omlette onto your plate. Use the second fork to eat the omlette.
