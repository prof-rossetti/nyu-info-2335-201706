# Class 5 Recap

Hello Students,

Good seeing you again last night.

We started class by repeating the process of updating our local and remote "forks" of the course repository. Coordinating with many of you individually to help you through this process took more time than I anticipated, but it took less time than last class, so I believe we are collectively making progress! And thanks to many of you for helping classmates through this process!

After ensuring all student forks were up-to-date, we finished and submitted the ["Groceries" project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/projects/groceries/project.md) together. This is the first time I asked you to push your own project repository to GitHub.com as part of the submission process, so it also took more time than anticipated to walk some of you through it. But again, thanks for helping each other!

During the latter half of class we took a more detailed look at the expectations of the ["Shopping Cart" project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/projects/shopping-cart/project.md), and we finished the first checkpoint together. Finally, I encouraged you to try your best to finish the project for homework. I have pushed back the due date until after next class, which will give you an opportunity to ask questions during class if necessary, however I'm not sure if we will be able to dedicate time to working on it together during class, so try as best as possible to complete it beforehand.

At the beginning of next class we will use one of the "Further Exploration" challenges of the "Shopping Cart" project to introduce techniques for reading and writing files in Python. I will then introduce you to the next project (the "CRUD Application"), which involves reading and writing CSV files, and my goal is to actually provide you with at least 90 minutes to work on it during class. :smiley:

Please contact me directly, or ask a question in the `#2335` Slack channel over the weekend if you have questions about completing or submitting the Shopping Cart project. Otherwise have a great weekend, and see you on Monday!
