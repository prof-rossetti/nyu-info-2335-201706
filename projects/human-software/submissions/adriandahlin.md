## Toothbrushing for Saber-Toothed Cats

1. Catch a monkey. DON’T EAT THE MONKEY. #You don't have opposable thumbs.
2. Convince the monkey that you will spare its life in exchange for its help. If it refuses, threaten to eat its entire family.
3a. When the monkey acquiesces, instruct it to collect a straight stick of ⅜ in diameter and 11 inches in length.
3b. Instruct the monkey also to collect 50 pieces of straw. #Extra straw is helpful.
3c. Finally, instruct the monkey to find several pieces of leather string. #Cavemen may be a good source of leather. Monkeys are great thieves.
4. Instruct the monkey to tie the pieces of straw to the end of the stick. Be careful not to break too much of the straw. If the monkey breaks the leather string, remind it how strong you are.
5. Hold the monkey firmly in your front paws. FOR GOD’S SAKE, RETRACT YOUR CLAWS FIRST.
6. Instruct the monkey to scrub your teeth one at a time. Remind it that the small teeth need to be clean too. No sabertooth wants cavities in her molars.
7. After scrubbing each tooth, the monkey should clean the brush in water.
8. When the monkey is finished, DO NOT EAT THE MONKEY. This will make it very hard to find toothbrushing monkeys in the future, and it will make your teeth dirty.


## How to Join and Ride Citi Bike

1. Have a credit card ready. Log on to citibikenyc.com, click "Join" and fill out the form. Wait a few days for the electronic fob to arrive in the mail.
2. Download the Citi Bike app onto your smartphone from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.
3. Also download the CityMapper app.
4. When the fob arrives, grab your helmet, find the nearest Citi Bike station using the Citi Bike app, and walk to that station.
5. Place your helmet on your head and secure the strap.
6. Pick a bike and find a small slot on the bike stand to the left of the bike's handlebars. Insert the fob into this slot.
7. If the light turns green, remove the bike from the stand. If the light doesn't turn green, choose a different bike.
8. If you don't know how to ride a bike, download How_To_Ride_A_Bike.py. A partner will be helpful in this process.
9. Enter your destination into the CityMapper app. Choose the "bike" route option. This will give you directions that include only roads with bike paths.
10. Pedal your way down the paths indicated in the CityMapper app. Stay in the bike lanes whenever possible. Obey the rules of the road. Do not look at your smartphone while pedaling. If you need to look up your next turn, stop the bike on the side of the road first.
11. CityMapper will lead you to the Citi Bike station nearest your destination. When you reach the station, identify an unoccupied stand. Dismount from the bike and push the front wheel into the spot in the reverse motion you used to acquire the bike in the first place. Make sure the light turns green. If it does not, choose a different stand at the station.
12. Remove your helmet. Walk to your destination. Celebrate your health and sustainable citizenship.
