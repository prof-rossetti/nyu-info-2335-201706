JavaScript can be run on the "client-side" (i.e. in a browser) as well as on the "server-side" (i.e. on your computer or some other server). The quickest way to get started with JavaScript is by using the interpreter available within modern web browsers like Google Chrome or Firefox. For example, if using Chrome, right-click anywhere on a webpage and select the "Inspect Element" option. When a new window appears, click on the "Console" tab to find an interactive interpreter. There you should be able to follow-along with each of the sections below.
