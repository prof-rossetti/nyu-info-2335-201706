# Ruby Language Overview

## Comments

Use comments to convey some message without having it be executed by an interpreter. Comment by using the `#` sign followed by the commented message:

```ruby
# This is a single-line comment. It won't be executed.
```

For multi-line comments, either use `=begin ... =end` or put a comment on every line:

```ruby
=begin

This is a multi-line comment.
It won't be executed.

=end
```

```ruby
#
# This is a multi-line comment.
# It won't be executed.
#
```
