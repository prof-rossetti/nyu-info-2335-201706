## A Tennis Serve

Some written instructions here. Maybe numbered:

  1. Behind the baseline, stand with your dominant foot parallel to the baseline and your other foot pointing toward the net post. 
  2. Grab the ball and bounce it in front of your non dominant foot 3 times to prepare for your toss.
  3. Lean or step backward slightly (make sure you bend your knees slightly) and toss the ball directly up (height to comfort and pretend the ball is magnetized to your hand, which will ensure its tossed straight up); your upper body should be at a slight angle, with your tossing hand higher than the hand holding your racket (which is also angled- ready to hit the ball).
  4. Using your legs and momentum, aim for the opposite front court square, and proceed forward with the arm with your racket in it and hit the ball over the net in one motion. Your arm should proceed in two motions, first angled from behind your head and second, straight toward the opposite court. Remember to keep your head up as you hit the ball and fully follow-through.
  5. End in a ready position to volley.
