# Class 8 Recap

Hello Students,

Last night we focused on refactoring and testing (and submitting) the ["CRUD App" project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/projects/crud-app/project.md). I'm thankful for the opportunity to introduce you to these fundamental and valuable concepts of software development, and for your efforts in putting the concepts into practice.

I also briefly alluded to the upcoming ["Freestyle" Project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/projects/freestyle/project.md) and the existence of a few project [examples](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/tree/master/projects/freestyle/examples). I hope to add even more project examples before class starts tomorrow night, as we turn our focus to the "Freestyle" Project's [Proposal Phase](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/projects/freestyle/project.md#proposal-phase).

Before and/or during the first 30 minutes of next class I encourage you to read through the project description and examples to get familiar with the desired scope, and to develop an awareness of potential projects of interest. At the end of this process your goal is to identify or otherwise define a project idea you'd like to investigate further.

Then we will continue working independently for another 60 minutes to investigate potential technical solutions for implementing our chosen projects. For students who choose one of the project examples, relevant Python packages have already been identified for you, so your task is to see if you can use them. At the end of this investigation process your goal is to implement the simplest of Python programs to demonstrate your ability to perform some part of your project's desired functionality.

For the remaining 90 minutes I hope to introduce you to computer hardware by showing you how to "deploy" your software to a server. Or if you'd rather continue working independently on project investigation, you will have the opportunity to do so in the lounge.

See you then.

\- Professor Rossetti
