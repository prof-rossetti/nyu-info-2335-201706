] # Products based on data from Instacart: https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017
```

... write a script to transform it into the following information output:

    --------------
    THERE ARE 20 PRODUCTS:
     + All-Seasons Salt ($4.99)
     + Chocolate Fudge Layer Cake ($18.50)
     + Chocolate Sandwich Cookies ($3.50)
     + Cut Russet Potatoes Steam N' Mash ($4.25)
     + Dry Nose Oil ($21.99)
     + Fresh Scent Dishwasher Cleaner ($4.99)
     + Gluten Free Quinoa Three Cheese & Mushroom Blend ($3.99)
     + Green Chile Anytime Sauce ($7.99)
     + Light Strawberry Blueberry Yogurt ($6.50)
     + Mint Chocolate Flavored Syrup ($4.50)

     + Smart Ones Classic Favorites Mini Rigatoni With Vodka Cream Sauce ($6.99)
     + Sparkling Orange Juice & Prickly Pear Beverage ($2.99)
    --------------
    THERE ARE 10 DEPARTMENTS:
     + Babies (1 products)
     + Beverages (5 products)
     + Dairy Eggs (1 products)
     + Dry Goods Pasta (1 products)
     + Frozen (4 products)
     + Household (1 products)
     + Meat Seafood (1 products)
     + Pantry (2 products)
     + Personal Care (2 products)
     + Snacks (2 products)

### Setup

Create a new directory on your desktop called "python-practice" and navigate there from the command-line:

```shell
# Mac OS:
mkdir ~/Desktop/python-practice
cd ~/Desktop/python-practice

# Windows OS:
mkdir C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Desktop\python-practice
cd C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Desktop\python-practice
```

Initialize a new Git repository there:

```shell
git init .
```

Within the directory, create a new file called `groceries.py`. In this file, place the following code:

```python
import code

products = [] #<-- Copy and paste the provided products list here (see above!)

print(products)

# code.interact(local=locals())
```

Run the script to see it print the list of products.

Great, now you are ready to move on to the next step, so commit your code:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Setup new repository"
```

Un-comment the last line in your Python script - the one containing `code.interact(local=locals())`. This is known as "dropping a breakpoint" into your program.

Run the script again to enter an interactive debugging console. From within this console you should be able to access the `products` variable. When you are done exploring, type `exit()` to quit.

### Implementation

Iteratively revise and re-run the script to implement desired functionality. Use the breakpoint only when you find it helpful, otherwise keep it commented-out.

When you successfully demonstrate your script's ability to perform one or more component pieces of desired functionality, commit your changes before moving on to the next step. Your history of commit messages should roughly resemble the checkpoint steps below.

#### Checkpoint I - Printing Products

Steps:

  1. Print the number of products.
  2. Print the name of each product.
  3. Print in alphabetical order the name of each product.
  4. Print in alphabetical order the name of each product, and include its price rounded to two decimal places.

#### Checkpoint II - Printing Departments

Steps:

  5. Print the number of unique departments.
  6. Print the name of each unique department.
  7. Print in alphabetical order the name of each unique department.
  8. Print in alphabetical order the name of each unique department, as well as the number of products associated with that department.

## Submission Instructions

Push your repository to GitHub.com. Note the URL of your repository.

Update your fork of the course repository. In the [submissions.csv file](submissions.csv), add a new row including your GitHub username and the repository URL. The CSV file's rows should be ordered alphabetically by GitHub username. Commit your changes and submit a Pull Request for your content to be included in the course repository. See the [Contributor Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions. At this time, you are encouraged to use the Git CLI to submit your work.

## Evaluation

Full credit for presence of a Python program which runs without error and produces the desired information output.

Else half credit for presence of a Python program which doesn't run or doesn't exactly produce the desired information output.

Else no credit.
