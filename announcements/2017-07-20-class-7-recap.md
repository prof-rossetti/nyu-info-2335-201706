# Class 7 Recap

Hello Students,

Thank you for making last night's class a strong one.

We spent the entire class working on the ["CRUD App" project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/projects/crud-app/project.md), alternating between independent work and front-of-the-room demos. File writing presented a few challenges, but you shared strategies in Slack and helped each other through it. I'm very thankful for your collaboration. By the end of class a majority of you were almost finished with the project and I'm confident in your ability to complete it.

To prepare for next class, please try your best to submit the "CRUD App" project. If you are struggling, please ask questions in Slack. If you are unable to finish it before the beginning of class, I will likely encourage you to join a small group out in the lounge area so either myself or the TF can provide you with additional personalized attention.

Otherwise the primary focus of class on Monday will be on refactoring and testing our apps (which is why it's important to finish them before-hand). I'm most excited about this subject matter, and I hope you will find it valuable as well.

Have a great weekend everyone.

\- Professor Rossetti

Note: I have some family obligations this weekend - Saturday especially - so I may be more offline than usual. Please plan accordingly.
