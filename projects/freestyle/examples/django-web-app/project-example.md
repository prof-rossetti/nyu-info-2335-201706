# Freestyle Project Example - CRUD Application w/ Web Interface and SQL Database (Django and PostgreSQL Implementation)

Use Python to create a CRUD application with a web browser-based interface and SQL datastore.

For optional further exploration, deploy your application to a Heroku server and visit it online. Optionally configure the Heroku server to execute one of the application's scripts at scheduled intervals.

For optional further exploration, integrate any one of the other project examples to provide a web browser-based interface.

## Prerequisites

  1. Foundational understanding of Databases and SQL :warning:
  1. Foundational understanding of the Internet and HTML :warning:
  1. [Heroku Overview](/notes/hardware/heroku.md)
  1. [The Email API Client Project Example](/projects/freestyle/examples/email-api-client/project-example.md) -- if you are to attempt this web application project you must be able to complete this prerequisite project to gain a foundational understanding of what it means to deploy an application to a production Heroku server
  1. [The `virtualenv` Python Package](/notes/programming-languages/python/packages/virtualenv.md)
  1. [The `Django` Python Package](/notes/programming-languages/python/packages/django.md)

## Proposal Phase

Example Objective(s):

  + Manage an inventory of products using a web-based interface

Example Information Inputs (depending on the chosen objectives):

  + Information input by a user through the web interface

Example Information Outputs (depending on the chosen objectives):

  + Perhaps some information presented via the web interface

## Implementation Phase

First, follow the [setup guide](setup.md) to setup your project to be run on a local "development" webserver.

Then, optionally follow the [deployment guide](deploying.md) to setup your project to be run on a remote "production" webserver. This is perhaps the most rewarding part of creating a web application.

Next, follow the [implementation guide](implementation.md) and consult with the professor to implement your own project's desired functionality.
