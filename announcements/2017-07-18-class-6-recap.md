# Class 6 Recap

Hello Students,

Great work everyone so far. I see you becoming more and more comfortable with Python and Git and the command-line with each passing class. The project submission processes is starting to "click" and the fork-updating process has become more routine. You are making great progress. Let's continue to put in the time and effort to achieve a strong second half of the semester.

Last night in class we submitted and reviewed an example implementation of the ["Shopping Cart" project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/projects/shopping-cart/project.md#submission-instructions). We also introduced and spent time working on the ["CRUD App" project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/projects/crud-app/project.md).

To prepare for next class, please make sure you have completed the "CRUD App" project's [setup instructions](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/projects/crud-app/project.md#setup).

Tomorrow night we will work on the "CRUD App" together during a significant portion of class. We will also likely discuss Software Licensing.

See you then.

\- Professor Rossetti
