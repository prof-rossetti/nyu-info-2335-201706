# Class 1 Recap

Hello Students.

It was a pleasure meeting you in class this week. I especially appreciated your attention and participation, as well as the experience and perspective you bring to class.

During the [first class](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md#class-1---wednesday-2017-06-28) we discussed course operations and context. Then we started an exercise in writing software in English and ended by sharing and reflecting on the process.

As we prepare for our next class on Monday, make sure you have installed a text editor. I'd also like to invite you to attempt to [submit](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/projects/human-software/project.md#submission-instructions) the Human Software assignment using the written instructions provided. I believe you will be able to do this on your own, but we will also spend a few minutes during the beginning of next class to explain the process.

[Next class](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md#class-2---monday-2017-07-03) we will cover command-line computing and version control. And we will install Python 3 and start using it to satisfy the objectives of our next project.

Have a great weekend, and Slack me if you have any questions!
