Your local corner grocery store has hired you to help them modernize their checkout system.

Currently, the store affixes a price tag to each grocery item in stock. But the store owner wants to be able to change product prices at any given time. The store owner does not want to wait until all currently-priced items sell-out before being able to charge a different price for that type of item. And if there are any price tags that differ from prices charged at checkout, that would lead to confusion and a poor customer experience.

The store owner describes a desired checkout process which involves a clerk scanning each item's barcode to look up its price. You agree using a barcode scanner would be a helpful process improvement.

The store owner says the barcode scanners are somewhat expensive, so it would be ideal to test out the process before making a hardware purchase. You offer to write a free Python program that can be run on the store's computers, but in order to use it, you ask the store owner to maintain a list of currently-offered products and the current price of each. You also ask the store owner to mark each product with a unique identifier instead of a hard-coded price tag. You explain the identifier can be used to look up the price and any other relevant information associated with any given item.

The store owner agrees! Now its time to write software to mimic the barcode-scanning process.

## Objectives

  1. Practice writing software in Python.
  1. Practice contributing to open source software.
  1. Practice version control.

## Instructions

TBA - write a program that asks the user to input one or more product identifiers, then looks up the prices for each, then prints an itemized customer receipt including the total amount owed. The program should use the following dictionary to represent the store owner's database of products and prices:

```py
