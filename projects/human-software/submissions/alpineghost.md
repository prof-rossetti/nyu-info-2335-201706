I'm making an edit to clarify that these instructions are for brushing human teeth and the instructions below are for a non electric and non motorized bicycle

## Brushing Teeth

  1. Enter the bathroom.
  2. Hold your toothbrush between your thumb and fingers of your dominant hand.
  3. Turn on the faucet.
  4. Rinse the brush under the water.
  5. Turn off the faucet.
  6. Take the toothpast tube and open it.
  7. Spread a dollop of toothpast onto the bristles of the toothbrush.
  8. Insert the toothbrush in your mouth.
  9. Brush your bottom teeth with a back-and-forth motion.
    a. First brush the top of the teeth.
    b. Then brush the outside of the teeth.
    c. Finally brush the inside of the teeth.
 10. Repeat these three steps for the top teeth.
 11. Spit out whatever is in your mouth.
 12. Rinse the toothbrush under water.
 13. Replace the toothbrush in its original place.

## Changing Inner tube on your bike

  1. Remove the wheel from the bike.
  2. Unscrew the cap from the valve.
  3. Fully deflate the tube.
  4. Insert a tire lever between the tire and the rim.
  5. Insert a second tire lever betwen the tire and the rim.
  6. Slide the second tire lever around the wheel to dislodge the tire.
  7. Remove the tube with the hole.
  8. Inflate the new tube at 30 percent.
  9. Insert the valve of the slightly inflated tube in the valve hole.
  10. Gently go around the wheel placing the inflated tube into the tire.
  11. Use your fingers to replace the tire onto the rim.
  12. Check that the valve is aligned and the tire is in place.
  13. Fully inflate the tube to the recommended pressure.
  14. Replace the wheel on the bike.
